# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-CNN-XGBoost-Real-Time-Inference

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is an important problem in computer vision, enabling systems to understand human actions from images or videos.
In this project, we build a complete end-to-end activity classification system using:

✔️ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN – ResNet18 Fine-Tuned)

✔️ PCA-based Feature Compression

✔️ XGBoost Classifier

✔️ A Real-Time Webcam Prediction Pipeline

✔️ A Gradio Web Application for Upload/Live Inference
