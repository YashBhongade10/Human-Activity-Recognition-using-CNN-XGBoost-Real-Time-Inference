# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-CNN-XGBoost-Real-Time-Inference

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of classifying different human activities from images.  
The model is trained on a custom dataset consisting of multiple activity classes such as *hugging, fighting, handshake,* and more.

This repository contains:
- Complete source code
- Trained model files (optional)
- Report for academic submission
- Demo video demonstrating the working project
